Hi all! With just under a week left in the nominations period, we wanted to
share a few reminders about nominations for this exchange:

- Tags **must** be nominated to the 2024 tagset if you want to use them in your
  sign-up. Canonical tags are not included by default and while some tags were
  carried over from previous years' exchanges, many were not. Double-check that
  your favorite is part of the 2024 tagset!
- Nominating tags does **not** mean you have to sign up for the exchange! Even
  if you're not participating, you can nominate tags to encourage others to
  create for ships you like. You can also nominate ships that you might want to
  create treats for!
- Tags must include at least one Elvhen character to be accepted and OC/PC
  characters must include a gender & background (i.e. Female Surana, Male
  Lavellan)
- You are not limited to existing canonical tags! As long as your tag meets our
  other requirements, you can manually type it into the nominations box and we
  will add it to the tagset. Go wild, rarepair and minor NPC lovers! ðŸ™Œ

![A two-panel comic known as "Two Button Meme". The first panel shows two red buttons and a hand hovering over them. The button on the left is labeled "My Favorite Elf Ship"; the button on the right is labeled "The Elf Ship I Found During Nominations". The second panel is a muscular man in a tight red shirt resembling a super hero costume, wiping his sweating forehead as if too nervous to choose.](/img/banners/choices.png)

## We are just under one week away from sign-ups closing!

We’ll post a 48 and 24 hour warning for all of you still tinkering with
adjusting things and editing, as well.

**Reminder to check your AO3 emails.** We will begin reviewing existing sign-ups
tomorrow, and if there are any clarifications needed, we'll let you know.

**If you signed up with any Treats related tag on your offers, please do the
mods a favor and edit your offers to remove those tags.** We would really
appreciate your help with that!

_**PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN EDITING!!!**_ **AO3 has been known to add “Additional
Tags” to your selections.** This means that if you go back in to edit, it may
select “Fanart” (or other tags) for you, even though you did not want it to. If
you edit your sign-up, please check this very carefully on your requests. If you
discover there was an issue AFTER assignments go out, please let a mod know
immediately.

Have questions? Feel free to email us!

# Basics

Arlathan eXchange is a fanfic and fanart exchange hosted on AO3 focusing on Elvhen characters from Dragon Age. Participants sign up with their wants for a new fanart or fanfic gift, and offer to create a new piece for another fan in exchange. All pieces should have at least one elf character as a focus (either as the main character or the relationship to/with the character as a focus).

Pieces can be character studies (solo), gen fic (friendship, non-romance), or romantic/sexual in nature.

## Rules
### The Basics
1. All works in the exchange must be part of the **Dragon Age** fandom. For requests and offers, please use *Dragon Age - All Media Types*. When you post you should post with the tags that fit your work, i.e. *Dragon Age: Origins*, etc. **Crossover works are not allowed.**
2. All ratings and kinks/fetishes are allowed so long as they do not violate your requestor's DNWs and they are tagged appropriately.
3. The exchange allows dark fic, works which deal with substance abuse and other "problematic" themes, so long as a main character is an elf. **Please be sure to list anything you do not want to receive in your requests.** When fulfilling requests, make sure to tag "problematic" content!
4. The exchange does not accept works featuring minor-aged characters (under 18) in sexual situations. However, we will accept non-sexual romantic works featuring characters aged 16+, and gen or solo fic featuring characters of all ages.
5. Please do not alter skintone drastically from canon. In short, no white washing. If you have questions please reach out to moderators.
6. Please do not change the sexual orientation of canonically homosexual characters (i.e. no pieces which depict Dorian with a female character or Sera with a male character) or make canonically trans characters cis. Other bisexual headcanons, trans/nb headcanons, and genderswap/sexswap works are okay.

### The Works
7. By signing up you agree you will create one 1000 word fic or completed art piece (clean lineart) for your assigned giftee by the end of the exchange. There is no maximum word count.
8. All works should adhere to basic readability standards.
9. Stories and art should be created specifically for the exchange. However, they may be part of an ongoing series or collection you already have. (i.e. if someone requests Solas/m!Lavellan and you already have a series with these characters, you can make this a part of the same AU and add it to your own series/collection; please do not add works to personal series until after creator reveals). All fics should be able to stand on their own, though, so please don't create a piece which would require someone to have read your entire 150,000 word slowburn fic in order to follow it.
10. If the request is not specific you may use your own OCs, default/generic OCS, or the requestor's OCs to fulfill requests. Anyone requesting specifically their own OCs should have information available in their letter or available on social media so the gifter can find out more!

### Problems/Troubleshooting
- Questions about OCs, DNWs, or prompts should be directed to your recipient's tumblr ask box while on anon. If anon asks are not on or you are unable to find their tumblr, that is okay. Please reach out to the mods through DM on tumblr, twitter, or Discord DM, and we'll reach out to your recipient to get answers to your questions.
- If you cannot complete your piece, reach out to a moderator ASAP.
- If there is a conflict between participants which cannot be resolved or a problem with your assignments or gift, please reach out to a moderator immediately.

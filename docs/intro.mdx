Arlathan eXchange is a fanfic and fanart exchange hosted on AO3 focusing on
Elvhen characters from Dragon Age. Participants sign up with their wants for a
new fanart or fanfic gift, and offer to create a new piece for another fan in
exchange. All pieces should have at least one elf character as a focus (either
as the main character or the relationship to/with the character as a focus).

Pieces can be character studies (solo), gen fic (friendship, non-romance), or
romantic/sexual in nature. Although pieces do not have to match to a recipient's
requests or prompts exactly, creators should strive to present their recipients
with a gift they will enjoy while respecting any "do not wants".

Arlathan eXchange is a [The Hanged Man](https://thehangedmanpub.netlify.app/)
event.

## Rules

### The Basics

1. All works in the exchange must be part of the **Dragon Age** fandom.
   **Crossover works are not allowed.**

2. All ratings and kinks/fetishes are allowed so long as they do not violate
   your requestor's DNWs and they are tagged appropriately.

3. The exchange allows dark fic including works which deal with substance abuse
   and other potentially sensitive or triggering themes, so long as a main
   character is an elf. This means the exchange allows themes or works you may
   consider "problematic". **Please be sure to list anything you do not want to
   receive in your requests as a DNW.** Please see
   [FAQs: What are Do Not Wants?](/docs/faqs#what-are-do-not-wants-dnws).

4. The exchange does not accept works featuring minor-aged characters (under 18)
   in sexual situations. However, we will accept non-sexual romantic works
   featuring characters aged 16+, and gen or solo fic featuring characters of
   all ages.

5. Please do not alter skintone drastically from canon. In short, no white
   washing. If you have questions please email moderators.

6. Please do not change the sexual orientation of canonically homosexual
   characters (i.e. no pieces which depict Dorian with a female character or
   Sera with a male character) or make canonically trans characters cis. Other
   bisexual headcanons, trans/nb headcanons, and genderswap/sexswap works are
   okay.

### The Works

7.  By signing up you agree you will create one 1000 word fic or completed art
    piece (clean line art) for your assigned recipient by the end of the
    exchange. There is no maximum word count.

8.  All works should:

    - be able to be posted on AO3
    - adhere to basic readability standards
    - feature a requested character or relationship
      - unless it is a DNW other characters and ships may also make an
        appearance or be mentioned, but the main focus of the piece should be at
        least one of your recipient's requested characters or ships
    - strive be a gift your recipient will enjoy

    _This does not mean you must write a recipient's prompt or request exactly,
    but it does mean you should attempt to create a work you truly believe they
    will enjoy while also avoiding any "do not wants"._

9.  Stories and art should be created specifically for the exchange. However,
    they may be part of an ongoing series or collection you already have. For
    example, if someone requests Male Lavellan/Solas and you already have a
    series with these characters, you can make this a part of the same AU and
    add it to your own series/collection.

    All fics should be able to stand on their own, though, so please don't
    create a piece which would require someone to have read your entire 150,000
    word slowburn fic in order to follow it. _Please be sure to add any series
    or collections which could identify you after creator reveals._

10. You may use your own OCs, default/generic OCs, or the requestor's OCs to
    fulfill requests with original characters. Anyone requesting specifically
    their own OCs should have information available in their letter or available
    on social media so the gifter can find out more!

    :::warning A Note About OC requests

    Please note that although you can request your own OC be used for a gift,
    you should not use a request with an original character to box a creator
    into creating only for your own OC. You may state that you only want your
    own OC for some ships; however, your requests must then contain at least one
    ship consisting of only canon characters or of ships where you are open to
    OCs other than your own.

    Requests for OC art should have more than one reference for the character's
    face and body. Written descriptions are not enough for an OC art request!

    :::

11. Works should not consist primarily of AI generated content.

    :::info On AI Generated Content

    Part of the fun (and the spirit) of fanworks exchanges is creating something
    for someone you know they will like - and hopefully, will love. We firmly
    believe using AI to generate the entirety of a gift goes against the
    creative gift-giving nature of exchanges.

    However, we do recognize and understand that computer learning models
    (recently, commonly called AI) have been used under other names for years to
    assist with generating creative works. While most of us understand
    intuitively that there is a difference between using assistive technology
    such as filters on a graphics program or grammarly for writing and feeding
    ChatGPT a prompt, we thought we'd outline in a little more detail what would
    be okay for the exchange and what wouldn't.

    **Allowed AI Use**

    - generating a prompt you then write
    - generating an outline for a fic you write
    - filters and effects applied to your own artwork
    - assisted editing of your own fic or art (changing lighting, angle,
      perspective, grammar, rephrasing sentences, etc)

    **Disallowed AI Uses**

    - feeding an AI a prompt and asking it to generate the artwork or fic
      itself, even if you edit the fic or artwork further

    In general, using computer learning model _tools_ to assist with something
    you are creating on your own is fine! Using them as a short-cut to
    completely skip the creative process is not.

    If you have any questions at all, please contact the mods!

:::warning Important

This collection does not accept previously published works, even after reveals,
when open for treats.

### More Details

12. You must comment on gifts you receive by Creator reveals, with a comment
    that's at least one complete sentence. Leaving comments can be difficult, so
    gif responses and memes are okay, but if you use those, please also add a
    few words to thank your creator for their hard work!

    :::note

    You are not _required_ to comment on any treats you receive; however, if you
    cannot distinguish whether a gift you've received is a treat or your main
    gift, you should comment on both. It's good etiquette to comment on all
    works received. Please see
    [FAQs: Help! I didn't get a comment!](/docs/faqs#help-i-didnt-get-a-comment)
    for more information on comments and commenting requirements.

    :::

13. Since Dragon Age is a rated mature video game, we assume most participants
    will be over the age of 18 and capable of handling the darker fantasy themes
    of the source materials. If you are under the age of 18 you may still
    participate but we ask you list "smut" or "sexual content" in their DNWs.

14. **Communications:** Communications with the mod team for specific issues,
    questions, or problems should occur through the mod email
    arlathanxchange@gmail.com or by using the forms found on this site. General
    questions/clarifications may also be asked in the
    [Discord](https://discord.gg/F73NDYMeGC) or sent via
    [tumblr ask](https://arlathanxchange.tumblr.com/ask).

    :::tip

    Since the primary method of communication with the mod team is email, please
    be sure that the email on your AO3 account is up-to-date and you still have
    access to it. Please also check this email frequently throughout the
    exchange!

    :::

15. **These rules are non-exhaustive.** While we have attempted to be thorough,
    it is impossible for us to address every potential issue or situation which
    could arise during the course of the event in single document. For more
    specific situations, questions, or issues, please see the [FAQs](/docs/faqs)
    or read through the tutorials. If you're unable to find the information
    you're looking for, please contact the mod team and we'll be happy to help!

  anonymity. If you have any doubts that you will be able to do this or are
  concerned they may sus you out, please have the moderators ask your questions

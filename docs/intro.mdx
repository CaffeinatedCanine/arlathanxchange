# Basics

Arlathan eXchange is a fanfic and fanart exchange hosted on AO3 focusing on
Elvhen characters from Dragon Age. Participants sign up with their wants for a
new fanart or fanfic gift, and offer to create a new piece for another fan in
exchange. All pieces should have at least one elf character as a focus (either
as the main character or the relationship to/with the character as a focus).

Pieces can be character studies (solo), gen fic (friendship, non-romance), or
romantic/sexual in nature.

## Rules

### The Basics

1. All works in the exchange must be part of the **Dragon Age** fandom. For
   requests and offers, please use _Dragon Age - All Media Types_. When you post
   you should post with the tags that fit your work, i.e. _Dragon Age: Origins_,
   etc. **Crossover works are not allowed.**

2. All ratings and kinks/fetishes are allowed so long as they do not violate
   your requestor's DNWs and they are tagged appropriately.

3. The exchange allows dark fic including works which deal with substance abuse
   and other potentially sensitive or triggering themes, so long as a main
   character is an elf. This means the exchange allows themes or works you may
   consider "problematic". **Please be sure to list anything you do not want to
   receive in your requests as a DNW.** For more information see
   [FAQs: What are Do Not Wants?](/docs/faqs#what-are-do-not-wants-dnws).

4. The exchange does not accept works featuring minor-aged characters (under 18)
   in sexual situations. However, we will accept non-sexual romantic works
   featuring characters aged 16+, and gen or solo fic featuring characters of
   all ages.

5. Please do not alter skintone drastically from canon. In short, no white
   washing. If you have questions please reach out to moderators.

6. Please do not change the sexual orientation of canonically homosexual
   characters (i.e. no pieces which depict Dorian with a female character or
   Sera with a male character) or make canonically trans characters cis. Other
   bisexual headcanons, trans/nb headcanons, and genderswap/sexswap works are
   okay.

### The Works

7. By signing up you agree you will create one 1000 word fic or completed art
   piece (clean line art) for your assigned recipient by the end of the
   exchange. There is no maximum word count.

8. All works should adhere to basic readability standards.

9. Stories and art should be created specifically for the exchange. However,
   they may be part of an ongoing series or collection you already have. (i.e.
   if someone requests Solas/m!Lavellan and you already have a series with these
   characters, you can make this a part of the same AU and add it to your own
   series/collection). All fics should be able to stand on their own, though, so
   please don't create a piece which would require someone to have read your
   entire 150,000 word slowburn fic in order to follow it.

   <span className="inlineNote">
     {" "}
     Please be sure to add any series or collections which could identify you _after_
     creator reveals.
   </span>

10. If the request is not specific you may use your own OCs, default/generic
    OCS, or the requestor's OCs to fulfill requests. Anyone requesting
    specifically their own OCs should have information available in their letter
    or available on social media so their creator can find out more!

:::note

This collection does not accept previously published works, even after reveals,
when open for treats.

### Problems/Troubleshooting

- Questions about OCs, DNWs, or prompts should be directed to your recipient's
  tumblr ask box _while on anon_. **If anon asks are not on or you are unable to
  find their tumblr, that is okay.** Please reach out to the mods through DM on
  tumblr, Discord DM, or email and we'll reach out to your recipient to get
  answers to your questions.

- If you cannot complete your piece, Contact a moderator ASAP for an extension
  or to default. Please see
  [FAQs: I can't complete my assignment. What do I do?](/docs/faqs#i-cant-complete-my-assignment-what-do-i-do)
- If there is a conflict between participants which cannot be resolved or a
  problem with your assignments or gift, please reach out to a moderator
  immediately.

# Treats & Treatless FAQ

## What are treats?

Treats are fancreations that you receive <u>in addition to</u> the one which was
assigned to be created for you. They are extra gifts! Treats are still required
to be focused on a character or ship you've asked for and to follow your DNWs,
but they can be much shorter or may only be sketches instead of complete clean
line art.

Treats can be gifted to more than one person; for example, if four people have
requested Varric Tethras/Female Lavellan, and you've drawn fanart which doesn't
violate any of their DNWs, you can treat that to all four participants.

You could receive one treat, multiple treats, or no treats.

Treats may also be given to the exchange as a whole, by placing them in the
collection, and NOT completing the "Gift to" section. You can treat the
collection with characters or ships which are on the nominations list but didn't
make it to the requests, creations which don't quite fit a single prompt (maybe
the ships were requested but there are DNWs in your creation), or treats which
fit so many prompts to gift it directly to so many participants would be
cumbersome.

For more information on how to give a treat, please see
[How do I give a Treat?](#how-do-i-give-a-treat)

:::tip

To make sure you can receive treats, please double check your Gift settings,
especially if your AO3 account was created after 04 Feb 2022 by going to
`My Preferences` → `Collections, Challenges, and Gifts` and make sure **Allow
anyone to gift me works** is checked.

## I only want specific treats for specific prompts.

During sign-ups you can indicate what type of treats (if any) you want for each
group of pairings you request. In the `Additional Tags` box, please select what
types of treats you'd be open to receiving for each prompt. You could, for
example, select `Fanfic` and `Treats - Fanart`; this would indicate that you'd
rather have fanfic for a main gift, but would accept a fanart treat.

`Treats - Other` indicates you would be willing to receive other fan creations
like fanmixes, podfic (of a new or existing story), moodboards, etc.

## This is cool and all, but... I don't want treats.

We understand. We ask that you do three things in order to help make sure you
don't receive treats:

- during Sign-Ups please make sure to click `No Treats Please` in the
  `Additional Tags` section of your sign-up on your prompts

- To be explicit, please list "Treats" as part of your **Do Not Wants**.

- Finally, check your AO3 settings to make sure treats cannot be given outside
  of assignments. To do this, go to `My Preferences` →
  `Collections, Challenges, and Gifts` and make sure **Allow anyone to gift me
  works** is not checked.

## What does "Treatless" mean?

Treatless participants are ones who haven't been gifted at least one treat. Many
exchange participants like to make sure everyone gets a treat, so they work hard
to clear the Treatless List, by writing or drawing more than one piece during
the creation period. "Treatless" is our way of identifying those who haven't
gotten an extra gift yet.

## Where is the Treatless List?

Many exchanges create a separate Google Sheets spreadsheet which lists all of
the treatless individuals and may or may not link to their requests. The AutoAO3
App which we're using for our requests spreadsheet allows a lot of cool sorting
and filtering tricks, and we're using that to compile our treatless list.

Once someone has received a treat, the mods will add an `Additional Tag` which
says **Treat Received**.

To find Treatless participants you only have to filter the request list for
those people who do NOT have that tag by using `!"Treat Received"`in the
**Freeforms:** box as shown below:

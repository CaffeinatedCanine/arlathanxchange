title: Keeping It Anon

During the collection and exchange set-up process the moderators have the
ability to set the collection to both unrevealed and anonymous. Unrevealed works
mean that the titles are not known and no one can view the work. Anonymous means
that the authors are unknown.

As part of the fun of our exchanges, we like to reveal the works for a week, to
allow people to read, comment, and enjoy their works, while speculating on who
gave them their gift and treats. During this week long period you can reply to
comments and your identity will remain secret. Many people like to "accuse"
others of having created for them. Hilarity ensues.

But sometimes you may want to keep a work anonymous without orphaning or
abandoning the work. This allows you to still see comments, track stats, and
eventually reveal the work on your own terms. You may want to do this if it is a
pairing or trope you don't normally write, or simply because you like the
mystique.

Remaining anonymous is as simple as adding an anonymous collection to the work.
**ao3commentoftheday** wrote a great guide on anonymous collections, how to use
them, and how to remove them. You can find that guide

on their blog.

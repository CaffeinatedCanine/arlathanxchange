# How to Fulfill Your Assignment

There are three very easy ways to fulfill your exchange assignment once you receive it.

:::note

These instructions only deal with fulfilling your assigned request for the exchange. If you're looking for how to give a treat, please see [Treats & Treatless FAQ - How do I give a Treat?](/docs/treats#how-do-i-give-a-treat)

:::

## From New Work
1. Once you're signed in to AO3, click on `Post` -> `New Work`.
2. Complete the New Work information as normal: Title, etc, etc.
3. In the `Associations` section above the normal **Post to Collection** box, you'll see a new section for "Does this fulfill a challenge assignment" and next to that a box with check options for which exchange assignment you're fulfilling. Check the box for the assignment you want to fulfill, and continue posting as normal!

<a href="#img1" class="preview">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/associations.png').default} alt="Associations" class="thumbnail"></img>
</a>
<p class="label">Associations: click to enlarge</p>
<p> </p>
<a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="img1">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/associations.png').default}></img>
</a>

:::warning

Both of these methods below require you to select a `Fulfill` button which is incredibly close to a `Default` button. Please be careful to select the correct button. If you accidentally default, please reach out to a moderator immediately!

## From Your Dashboard
1. Once you're signed in to AO3, click on `My Dashboard`.
2. On the left sidebar scroll down until you see `Assignments` and click the link. The number in the parenthesis will depend on how many exchanges you've participated in and assignments you've received.

<a href="#img2" class="preview">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/assignments.png').default} alt="Assignments Link" class="thumbnail"></img>
</a>
<p class="label">Assignments Link: click to enlarge</p>
<p> </p>
<a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="img2">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/assignments.png').default}></img>
</a>

3. Find your assignment for Arlathan eXchange and click the `Fulfill` button on the right hand side of the screen.

<a href="#img3" class="preview">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/fulfillfromdash.png').default} alt="FulFill Button" class="thumbnail"></img>
</a>
<p class="label">Fulfill Button: click to enlarge</p>
<p> </p>
<a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="img3">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/fulfillfromdash.png').default}></img>
</a>

4. This will automatically start a new work which will fulfill your assignment!

## From the Exchange Page
1. Once you're signed in to AO3, make your way to this year's AO3 profile for the exchange.
2. On the left sidebar scroll down until you see `My Assignment` and click the link.

<a href="#img4" class="preview">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/myassignment.png').default} alt="My Assignment Link" class="thumbnail"></img>
</a>
<p class="label">My Assignment Link: click to enlarge</p>
<p> </p>
<a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="img4">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/myassignment.png').default}></img>
</a>

3. You'll see your recipient's requests, and on the right hand side a button to `Default` and `Fulfill`. Click the `Fulfill` button.

<a href="#img5" class="preview">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/fulfillfromexchange.png').default} alt="FulFill Button" class="thumbnail"></img>
</a>
<p class="label">Fulfill Button: click to enlarge</p>
<p> </p>
<a href="#_" class="lightbox" id="img5">
<img src={require('/img/tutorial/fulfillfromexchange.png').default}></img>
</a>

4. This will automatically start a new work which will fulfill your assignment!

## Troubleshooting

### Help! I accidentally defaulted.
Please contact a moderator immediately via email or our exchange Discord.

### I need to edit and I can't find my work.
Your works for exchanges can be found before reveals in a couple of ways:
- From `My Dashboard` on the left-hand sidebar click on `Statistics`.
- From `My Works` on the top right click the `Works in Collections` button.
- From `My Dashboard` go to `Assignments` on the left-hand sidebar and then click on the title for your assignment for this exchange.

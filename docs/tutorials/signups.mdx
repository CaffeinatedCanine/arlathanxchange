title: How to Sign-Up
sidebar_position: 2
---

Sign-Ups consist of requests for which characters and relationship you want to
receive content of and offers for which ships and characters you'd be willing to
create for. Each participant may request up to 30 different ships or characters
and offer an unlimited number of ships or characters.

Once sign-ups are complete you will be matched to a participant who is
requesting at least one ship you are offering to create for, and you will be
expected to create a fanwork which meets the minimum requirements outlined
[here](../intro#the-basics).

Please keep in mind matches look for only **one ship or character** you have
offered to match to **one ship or character** your recipient has requested, so
you may receive an assignment where there is only one request you would like to
create. This is fine! _You will create a work based on this request._ The
matching will also make sure that artists are matched to people who want art and
writers are matched to people who want fic.

:::info

No one can see what you have offered except the moderators. If you are inspired
by a ship or prompt that was not one you offered, you are absolutely free to
write something different!

:::

1. **Once sign-ups open go to the main AO3 profile for the exchange.** In the
   left-hand sidebar you will see a link for the sign-up form. There is also
   sign-up button on the top right. Click one of these two.

   The sign-up form can also be accessed from the sign-up or tumblr posts!

## Requests

  alt="Request Example"
/>

2.  **Enter your requests.**<br /> There will be three request forms by default.
    To complete your request forms, follow the below steps:

    1.  **Title** (_Optional_)<br /> Use this field to name your pairing groups,
        add an extra note, or even add a content warning like "NSFW prompts
        below".

    2.  **Relationships**<br /> Put at least 1 and up to 3 nominated characters
        or ships you would like to receive content for. You must have at least 1
        relationship per request. These tags should match the tags in the tag
        set/nominations list _exactly_. The form will make suggestions from the
        tagset.

        To request the minimum amount of three ships, please put one
        relationship in each default form.

        :::note

        Your three requests should not consist of three requests which limit
        your creator to only creating your specific OC. You must have at least
        one requested ship for which you are happy to receive _any_ OC or which
        is canon characters only.

        :::

    3.  **Additional Tags**<br /> Choose what type of gifts and treats you would
        like to receive. Select as many as apply, but **please be sure not to
        select `No Treats Please` and a `Treats` option on the same request, as
        this is confusing!**

        - `Fanart` - you would like to receive a main gift that is fanart.
        - `Fanfic` - you would like to receive a main gift that is fanfic.
        - `No Treats Please` - you do not want to receive a treat for this
          prompt. (please be sure to mark this on every request if you want no
          extra gifts at all!)
        - `Treats - Fanart` - you are open to receiving a fanart treat.
        - `Treats - Fanfic` - you are open to receiving a fanfic treat.
        - `Treats - Other` - you are open to receiving an alternative fanworks
          treat (for example, a fanmix, podfic, etc.)

    4.  **Letter/OC Info** (_Optional_)<br /> Feel free to link to a general or
        specific exchange letter here. Please see
        [On Exchange Letters](/docs/tutorials/letters) for more
        information on exchange letters.

    5.  **Prompt/DNWs**<br />Must be completed even if it simply says "please
        see letter". You can add DNWs, specific prompts, or whatever you'd like
        here. Please see
        [FAQs - What Are Do Not Wants (DNWs)?](/docs/faqs#dnw)
        for more info!

    6.  **Add Another Request?** Button (_Optional_)<br /> Want to request more
        ships? Click this button to add another request form. You can add up to
        10 for a total of 30 ships/characters.

## Offers

<img
  src="/img/tutorial/offer.png"
  width="50%"
  className="center"
  alt="Offers Example"
/>

3.  **Enter your offers.**

    You must have at least 3 offers, but there's no maximum number of offers.
    However, please keep in mind that due to the way AO3 enforces the minimum
    number of characters/ships, you will need to fill out at least three offer
    forms.

    1.  **Relationships**

        Put at least 1 and up to 3 characters/relationships that you would like
        to create content for. To offer the minimum amount of 3, you should put
        one nominated tag in each form.

        - `Any Relationship` - Please click the "Any Relationship" button to
          indicate you're okay with creating content for ANY ship or character
          that was nominated. You should do this on all 3 Offer forms!

    2.  **Additional Tags**

        Choose whether you would like to create fanart or fanfic (or either).
        **Please do not click any `Treats` related tags on your offers!**

    3.  **Additional Info** (_Optional_)

        You can add info about people you would like to avoid being matched with
        or request that you not be matched with requests that only have smut or
        fluff or angst, etc, etc with 100% confidentiality. The mods will use
        this information to ensure that you receive prompts you can create for.

    4.  **Optional Tags** (_Optional_)

        Add as many nominated tags as you'd like to offer here, but please keep
        in mind that you do need to complete all three offer forms.

        :::danger

        Please note this field is a bit quirky and keep the following in mind if
        you decide to use it!

        - This field only allows **canonical** AO3 tags. Any tag which will be
          newly created in the exchange or which has not yet been wrangled
          cannot be entered here.

        - AO3 does not make sure these tags are in our approved tagset.
          Ineligible, non-nominated ships will be deleted without us contacting
          you.

        :::

    5.  **Add Another Offer** Button (_Optional_)

        Want to offer more ships? Click this button to add another offer form.
        You can add up to 10 offers.

4.  **Click the `Submit` button on the bottom right hand corner and you're
    done!**

    You can edit your requests and offers up until sign-ups close and the
    matching begins, so feel free to adjust and change things until the last
    minute!

:::warning

Be very careful if you edit your sign-ups. During an exchange last year we
noticed a bug where more "Additional Tags" can be selected on _Requests_ when
someone is editing. For example, Fanart may be added to your request, even
though you have only requested Fanfic. Please review your requests and offers
_very carefully_ after you edit.

**Thank you for your interest!**

# How to Sign-Up

Sign-Ups consist of requests for which ships and characters you want to receive
content of and offers for which ships and characters you'd be willing to create
for. Each participant may request and offer for up to 30 different ships or
characters.

Once sign-ups are complete you will be matched to a participant who is
requesting at least one ship you are offering to create for, and you will be
expected to create a fanwork which meets the minimum requirements outlined
[here](/docs/intro#the-basics).

Please keep in mind matches look for only **one ship or character** you have
offered to match to **one ship or character** your recipient has requested, so
you may receive an assignment where there is only one request you would like to
write. This is fine! _You will create a work based on this request._ The
matching will also make sure that artists are matched to people who want art and
writers are matched to people who want fic.

1. **Once sign-ups open go to the main AO3 profile for the exchange.** In the
   left-hand sidebar you will see a link for the sign-up form. There is also a
   sign-up button on the top right. Click one of these two.

:::note

The sign-up form is also linked on our tumblr and in the header and footer of
this website!

2. **Enter your requests.** You must have at least 1 request but can add up
   to 10. Please follow the guidelines below:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Requests</strong>: Expand for more info</summary>

- **Title** - _Optional_. Use it to name your pairing groups, add an extra note,
  or even add a content warning like "NSFW prompts below".
- **Relationships** - Put at least 1 and up to 3 nominated
  relationships/characters that you would like to receive content for. You must
  have at least 1 relationship per request. These tags should match the tags in
  the tag set/nominations list <u>exactly</u>. This means to request a piece
  with an individual character you should use `CharacterName (Solo)`.
- **Additional Tags** - Choose what type of gifts and treats you would like to
  receive. Select as many as apply, but please be sure not to select
  `No Treats Please` and a `Treats` option on the same request.
  - `Fanart` - you would like to receive a main gift that is fanart.
  - `Fanfic` - you would like to receive a main gift that is fanfic.
  - `No Treats Please` - you do not want to receive a treat for this prompt.
    (please be sure to mark this on every request if you want no extra gifts at
    all!)
  - `Treats - Fanart` - you are open to receiving a fanart treat.
  - `Treats - Fanfic` - you are open to receiving a fanfic treat.
  - `Treats - Other` - you are open to receiving an alternative fanworks treat
    (for example, a fanmix, podfic, etc.)
- **Letter** - _Optional_. Feel free to link to a general or specific exchange
  letter here. Please see [On Exchange Letters](/docs/tutorials/letters) for
  more information on exchange letters.
- **Prompt** - Must be completed even if it simply says "please see letter". You
  can add DNWs, specific prompts, or whatever you'd like here.
- **Add Another Request** Button - _Optional_. Want to request more than 3 ships
  or characters? Click this button to add another request form. You can add up
  to 10 for a total of 30 ships/characters.

<p class="label">Offer Form: click to enlarge</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Offers</strong>: Expand for more info</summary>

- **Relationships** - Put at least 1 and up to 3 relationships that you would
  like to create content for. You must have at least 1 relationship per offer.
  - `Any Relationship` - If you are very brave, please click the "Any
    Relationship" button to indicate you're okay with creating content for ANY
    ship or character that was nominated.
- **Additional Tags** - Choose whether you would like to create fanart or fanfic
  (or either).
  - Please do not click any `Treats` related tags on your offers!
- **More Info** - _Optional_. You can add info about people you would like to
  avoid being matched to with 100% confidentiality or request that you not be
  matched with requests that only have smut or fluff or angst, etc, etc. You may
  also include additional pairings in case you didn't have enough room to list
  every pairing you'd be willing to create for. If there are problems matching,
  the Mods will use these pairings to match manually!
- **Add Another Offer** Button - _Optional_. Want to offer more than three
  ships/characters? Click this button to add offer request form. You can add up
  to 10 offers for 30 ships/characters total.

4. **Click the `Submit` button on the bottom right hand corner and you're
   done!**

:::tip

You can edit your requests and offers up until sign-ups close and the matching
begins, so feel free to adjust and change things until the last minute!

:::

:::warning

Be very careful if you edit your sign-ups. During an exchange last year we
noticed a bug where more "Additional Tags" can be selected on _Requests_ when
someone is editing. For example, Fanart may be added to your request, even
though you have only requested Fanfic. We do not know if this has been
corrected. Please review your requests and offers _very carefully_ after you
edit.

**Thanks for your interest!**

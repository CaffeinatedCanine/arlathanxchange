## Andaran atish'an, lethallen.

Are you a fancreator for the Dragon Age fandom who loves all things elves? Do
you fool yourself every time you start DA:O by telling yourself this time you'll
do something other than the Dalish origin? Does Merrill steal your Hawke's heart
every playthrough? Are you trapped in Solavellan hell?

Then you've stumbled onto the right exchange!

Arlathan Exchange is a celebration of Elvhen characters and is open to gen fic,
ships, or solo/introspective pieces. Sign-ups are open to all fancreators
willing to create a new fanfic or fanart piece within the deadline.
